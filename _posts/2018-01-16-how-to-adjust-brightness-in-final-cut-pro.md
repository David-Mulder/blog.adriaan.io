Apple added a great feature in [Final Cut Pro X 10.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207877) called [advanced color grading](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204995). With this feature you have color wheels where you can color grade the image in a similar way as in Adobe Premiere Pro. It also supports brightness and seturation levels.

Go to _Color Inspector_ in the right side bar. If it does not show up there, go to _Window_ > _Go To_ > _Color Inspector_. As a default it gives you the classic color board. Change that to _Color Wheels_:
