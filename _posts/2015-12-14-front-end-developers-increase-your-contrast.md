title: Front end developers and designers, increase your contrast
layout: post
---

If you have a shiny Mac as a front end developer or designer you will see your webpages in the most beautiful way. Everyone with such a nice display will see your website in the best possible way.

But there are others. People with less great screens, people who use a display with a VGA-cable or bad splitter. Those people will see your website not is the most beautiful way.

So before you push your website to production, please go into your *System Preferences* > *Accessibilty* > *Display* and slide the *Display contrast* a little to the right. I use this setting:

![System Preferences Accessibility](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1079135/11785138/86cd3f1c-a280-11e5-998b-a1d8aaeadf19.png)

On behalf of the *not-so-great-display-people*,

Thanks!
