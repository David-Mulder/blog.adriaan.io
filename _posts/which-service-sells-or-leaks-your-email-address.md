Spam is in our lives for a long time. Although the search for "spam" is quite stable in Google Trends, The Netherlands is on number one for a while. Not sure why though, but maybe we like to hate it.

Maybe it explains my interest is spam as well, but let's stop with the reason why spam is so interesting and let's get into this funny spam thing.

For those who don't know where the term spam comes from, here a passage of [the official document](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2635) where the term is first used:

> The term "spam" as it is used to denote mass unsolicited mailings or netnews postings is derived from a Monty Python sketch set in a movie/tv studio cafeteria.  During that sketch, the word "spam" takes over each item offered on the menu until the entire dialogue consists of nothing but "spam spam spam spam spam spam and spam."  This so closely resembles what happens when mass unsolicited mail and posts take over mailing lists and netnews groups that the term has been pushed into common usage in the Internet community.

The document refers to the beautiful scetch from Monty Python, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE) if you want to see it.






Of course every provider has now a stable and reasonable good spam-filter, so usally you'll find all your spam emails in a convenient folder.

You can reply on the messages you will get like [James Veitch](http://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_this_is_what_happens_when_you_reply_to_spam_email) did.
